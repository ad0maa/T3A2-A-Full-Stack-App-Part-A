## <u>Purpose</u> 

Medi-life is a local doctor’s clinic that has come to our team of developers with a project to create an online booking platform for their patients. In the past, patients must call the clinic and book with the medical receptionist who entered the appointments into their scheduling software. The problem they face is the additional workload this booking system placed on their reception team, and they want to give the patients the ability to book their own appointments without needing to call the surgery during operating hours. 

## <u>Features</u>  

- Patients can register a new account to make a booking 

- Patients and the admin team can log in to the booking site with an existing account 

- Patients can select their preferred Doctor and book an appointment time 

- Appointment times are checked to see if there is an existing booking for that time  

- Patients can view their upcoming appointments 

- Patients can edit and delete their own appointments 

 
## <u>Possible Features</u> 

- Doctors are notified when a patient books an appointment with them 

- Doctors can accept or deny booking requests 

- User account can apply to become a doctor account pending admin’s approval 

## <u>Target Audience</u> 

This application is intended to ease the process of booking appointments at the clinic for both the patients of the clinic as well as the reception/administration team.
