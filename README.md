## <u>Purpose</u> 

Medi-life is a local doctor’s clinic that has approached our team of developers with a project to create an online booking platform for their patients. In the past, patients must call the clinic and book with the medical receptionist who entered the appointments into their scheduling software. The problem they face is the additional workload this booking system placed on their reception team, and they want to give the patients the ability to book their own appointments without needing to call the surgery during operating hours. 

## <u>Features</u>  

- Patients can register a new account to make a booking 

- Patients and the admin team can log in to the booking site with an existing account 

- Patients can select their preferred Doctor and book an appointment time 

- Appointment times are checked to see if there is an existing booking for that time  

- Patients can view their upcoming appointments 

- Patients can edit and delete their own appointments 

 
## <u>Possible Features</u> 

- Doctors are notified when a patient books an appointment with them 

- Doctors can accept or deny booking requests 

- User account can apply to become a doctor account pending admin’s approval 

## <u>Target Audience</u> 

This application is intended to ease the process of booking appointments at the clinic for both the patients of the clinic as well as the reception/administration team.

## <u>Initial drafts</u>

<p>In the user stories featured above we felt this information easily conveyed our clients needs. Originally we had utilized a different format based off of our research, but came to the conclusion these were overly verbose, below we have attached some examples of our early drafts.

<h2>Week One Screenshots</h2>

- On day one of the project we decided to implement the Agile workflow process; the first step involved us organizing a meeting with our team to discuss and plan the project's creation. The second step involved visioning and targets on the tasks that needed completing as well as the due dates and features required for the project. After the discussion we decided upon using Trello for our project management software.  

- Each morning we hosted standups and planned out our tasks for the days as well as the sprints ahead, these were added as cards in their respective section. We added color coding for specific team members. This helped to signify visually what task were allotted to what member.

- As you can see in these screenshot’s we added additional information within the cards as to avoid cluttering the board, on these checklist’s we went through and ticked off any task’s that were completed.
